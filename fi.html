    <h1> Formula 1</h1>
    <h2> Brief Introduction </h2>
    <p>
        Formula One cars are the world's fastest regulated road-course racing cars,
         owing to very high cornering speeds achieved by generating large amounts of aerodynamic downforce.
          Much of this downforce is generated by front and rear wings, which have the side effect of 
          causing severe turbulence behind each car.

    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p> Lewis Halminton was born on 7 Jaunary 1985 as a go kart racer </p>
    <p> Sir Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton MBE HonFREng (born 7 January 1985)
        Born and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton joined the McLaren Young Driver Programme in 1998.
         This led to a Formula One drive with McLaren from 2007 to 2012, 
        making him the first black driver to race in the series. In his debut season, 
        Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi Räikkönen by one point.
         The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion—making a crucial overtake on
          the last lap of the last race of the season—to become the then-youngest ever Formula One World Champion. 
        After six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013. 
        Changes to the regulations for 2014 mandating the use of turbo-hybrid engines saw the start 
        of a highly successful period for Hamilton, during which he won six further drivers' titles.
         Consecutive titles came in 2014 and 2015 during an intense rivalry with teammate Nico Rosberg.
          Following Rosberg's retirement in 2016,
           Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival in two championship battles,
            in which he twice overturned mid-season point deficits to claim consecutive titles again in 2017 and 2018.
             His third and fourth consecutive titles followed in 2019 and 2020 to equal Schumacher's record of seven drivers' 
             titles. Hamilton surpassed  100 race wins and pole positions in 2021.
         He will join Ferrari for the 2025 season.

     the most consecutive wins (10), and the most consecutive pole positions (8, shared with Ayrton Senna). Verstappen is set to remain at Red Bull until at least the end of the 2028 season after signing a contract extension.Verstappen was listed in the 2024 issue of Time as one of the 100 most influential people globally.
